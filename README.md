1. Developed a sophisticated AI platform that extracts various NLP features, including sentiment analysis, named
entity recognition, and text summarization, from app review data.
2. Performed extensive data preprocessing using techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization to
transform the raw data into a machinereadable format.
3. Created a Binary classification model using logistic regression and a text vectorization pipeline to predict
sentiment, and deployed the platform as a user-friendly web app using the Streamlit framework.
