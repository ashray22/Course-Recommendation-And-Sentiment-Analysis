This includes web pages that contain forms asking for usernames passwordsÂ credit cards and other sensitiveÂ information.Â In the near future Google plans to roll out a requirement for all web pages to be secured. Warning labels will become progressively more aggressive and eventually highlighted in red bold colors on the address bar.Â It is easy to see the consequences of not complying with this new requirement. You invest time money and energy to drive traffic to your website. Your users expect a secure browsing experience and will likely be deterred from using your page when they see such warning labels attached.Â There is a common misconception that securing a webpage over HTTPS requires expert server knowledge and is a costly and cumbersome process.Â The purpose of this course is designed to teach you everything you need to know about HTTPS and SSL certificates. We start with the basics. Exploring the theory and definitions that will be useful in developing your understanding.Â From there we dive into configuring a server on Digital Ocean and installing a free SSL certificate known as Let's Encrypt. We also explore setting up Cron Jobs on an Ubuntu server to automatically renew your certificate periodically.Â After completing this course you will easily be able to secure any web page using HTTPS and free SSL certificates.

Weâll take your natural intuition that society has told you to ignore and give you confidence through positive response based affirmation.

Youâll also come to understand that âThinkingâ and âKnowingâ are truly âcounter-intuitive.â  				      								    The only known quantum computer in the Universe is the human brain. It receives over  million bits of information every single second yet only processes  thousand bits per second. We spend the vast majority of waking state editing out that information. Itâs why people are so very tired at the end of the day even working a desk job. The level of concentration used just to block the massive amount of data streaming into the brain is hard work.  							      											    What is all that other information?  										      														    Everything youâve ever wanted to know about the past present or future. The Universe is a gossip that wants to tell you anything you want to know you just have to know how to listen and ask the right question. Just like doing a search on Google ask one way and get over a million different answers ask the same question a different way and *poof* what you want to know comes up.  													      																	    However in this case you and your brain are Google.  																     In this course youâll learn how to know anything about a person place thing or event anywhere in space/time. Here you will discover how to take your natural intuition and âturn it up to â through the scientifically proven skill. Commit a weekend to train your brain like others train for the Ironman race and your mind will start to work for you in ways you never realized were possible. Downloads provide you with all the material you'll need to print out. Bring a BLACK pen and your intuition.

2237,283014,https://www.udemy.com/course/html5-certification/,True,TweakCoder eLearning Solutions,14592,HTML 5 How I made websites in HTML5,135,	HTML  is the leading web development language nowadays. Those days are gone when HTML and CSS were enough to code a web page. Now the demand is high and though the competition. If you want to get a job in some IT company HTML  is one of the compulsory languages that every web development company expect from their employees. Or if you are a self-employed web developer then you are missing the world of innovation in HTML . 	What am I offering in this course?	There is a complete training of HTML  from Basic level to Advance degree in this course. In the starting at newbie level you will come to know about the essential elements we use in HTML and now in HTML . Then you will come to know what are the new features in this new version of the language and what is their use and where to use them. Afterwards you will come to know about developing your shapes by writing few lines of code. Then we will move to advance level in which you will learn to embed audios and videos in a professional way without any script and plugin. At the end of the course there is an extra section which is optional where you can learn about sockets and server sent events in a detailed way if you want to get deep in back end programming. 	Why should I buy this course? I could get this information on google also.	You could get all the details of anything on the google. But you can't get all the required and important stuff at one place only. I mean you can get a lot of websites from where you can learn HTML  for free. But trust me they are like reading a book. They only say the function of an element and they write code on how it works. You will never get a practical knowledge. If you buy my course you can learn by watching me writing the codes and explaining the meaning of each and every line. Moreover if you stuck at any part of the course you have to post on various forums and then wait for members to get a solution. But here you have many other options. You could read our discussion threads to get your solution. You can start your discussion thread and I will be there to help you with the best option. You can even privately message or mail me with your difficulties and I am online most of the time so you don't have to wait a lot to get the solution. 	You can read the curriculum to know more about the topics covering in this course. Plus there is an option for all my students to get items on demand. You can write me and I will publish it for you.  	Hope to see you inside.

This course brings together a wide variety of lessons learned from Dr. Dunbar's training as a veterinarian a scientific researcher an animal behaviorist a professional dog trainer and a young boy growing up on an English farm.  	  	This seminar will focus on many principles and methods that have  been scientifically proven in the research lab and then adapted for the  real-world environment and the many constraints that exist when a family of novices trains a pet dog in their home.  	  	  And just because his methods are supported by science doesn't mean that they have no heart.  In fact Dr. Dunbar is quick to criticize techniques that ask trainers to behave like dispassionate laboratory robots.  Instead he believes that we as trainers need to utilize our strengths as humans: our intuition our voice and our relationship with our dogs in order to be the best trainers we can be.  Then we can dispassionately measure and evaluate the results of our training so we can scientifically determine whether or not our methods are effective.  	  	  Whether you are a professional dog trainer veterinary clinician shelter worker groomer dog walker or simply a pet owner who is interested in the science of dog training and behavior modification this course will provide you with a wealth of exciting new ideas that you can immediately use to bring about positive change in your life with your dog.  	  	  Dr. Dunbar was instrumental in the popularization of dog friendly training methods that are enjoyable for dogs and their owners but also efficient and effective.  You'll learn techniques that are perfectly appropriate for the whole family and designed to produce well-behaved canine companions that are friendly and reliable.
