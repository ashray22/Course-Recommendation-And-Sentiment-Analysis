"This ridiculous app sends me notifications after 12am asking me if I know a certain person or to tell me that others with the same interests as me are following a certain person. The developers for this app need to make it a little more professional and not have it send people unimportant notifications in the middle of the night. 12:24AM HST is 6:24AM EST so it isn't a timezone problem, either. Yes, I know I can manage notifications and/or set my phone to DND, but that isn't the point here.",1,2022-08-03 16:00:14

They increased the cost of their what seemed already overpriced career premium. In addition the jobs are not too helpful if you change careers. Through my experience there has rarely been relevant job postings. Unfortunate because this should easily be 5 stars due to the brand they have created.

LinkedIn makes working with your settings very difficult. The app is not intuitive at all. This app is almost as bad as the desktop version.

Forced me to download the app simply to turn off 'open to recruiters' option. This should be possible from the Web in my opinion.

LinkedIn is slow to react to click requests in rapid succession but overall it is a great app. I take back all the good things I said about this app 5 minutes ago. If you accidentally bump a connection request it locks you out of sending a personalized invite and that makes the app a nightmare for connection attempts.

I just DL'd it today hoping it was better. Nope! The prompt came up for dark mode. I closed it. I don't want dark mode. The app went into dark mode anyway. I'm trying to access the settings to turn off auto-play (data hog) but it's a blank screen. Literally nothing there. I'll stick with the website. üôÑ,1,2022-04-27 22:40:55

You can get more staff who are willing to work remotely to assist in the review process so as not to keep jobs hanging. This is a service delivery failure.

Also, I want to get job recommendations that offer remote work instead of on site. Please add more locations for job filter",2,2022-01-26 15:59:36

"Been on LinkedIn for ages. The app though isn't as seamless as the website version, it does the job though fairly well. Some might even prefer the app version over the site one.

Job search could be disappointing at times. But there's lot to learn and unlearn in the platform. Got a few gigs on LinkedIn. Just make a presentable profile.",4,2021-09-15 18:59:22

I found this app very useful in my job searches until an update a few months ago. Now the job search filter isn't effective and gives hundreds of irrelevant job postings under your search criteria. If I wanted those kind of results I'd use Google. I absolutely detest the app now and I think it's just useless. It's another social media website with idiots spewing junk messages and nothing much for professional development anymore.,2,2021-07-24 16:14:34
"Seems like LinkedIn is forcing user to be Premium or face banned. Now i am permanently restricted based on vague reason... I barely used Linkedin on browser or apps. 3x LinkedIn has restricted my account without providing clear evidence of ""abnormal high traffic""",1,2021-07-24 14:26:56
"Awesome app, great for peofessional connections, keeping up to date with your industry and the world. Please invest time to optimize your profile and define who you are going to follow - it is not that the app is bad, the problem is that people don't filter their feeds like they do in real life.",5,2021-07-24 13:40:35
Very very worst. App is not properly working. When I try to login using my gmail it says your account restricted. Its asking my proof to upload. No other social media won't ask our proof.,1,2021-07-24 10:34:00
"According to my views it's better then other other social sites like Facebook and Instagra. The most likeable feature here is to make connection . Here you can be in contact with educated as well as well behaved personality , you can find jobs according to your preference, you can build up your own profile and it's strength .I really love this app ,it's not like this app doesn't have any bugs it too have bugs and there's always a scope of improvement, Hope so it will be clear up in next update.",3,2021-07-24 10:08:58

"You can't even search without premium monthly limit? A simple SEARCH? This is the worst I've ever seen. Not everyone can afford the extra. Also, bare minimum should not have been monetized. LinkedIn talks about ""caring"" on it's posts, yet I can't see it. Upsetting and downside.",1,2021-07-22 09:56:21
"I was originally doing a search for someone. The next thing I know, I was probed to login to LinkedIn under a special edition. Therefore, I had to join and install this app to get in contact with the person. So far, it is very interesting and captured my attention as I read eye-catching articles and watched attractive images and videos. Under the regular LinkedIn, I use to just send text messages to my connections that I haven't been in touch with for so long. And then, I would quickly log out.",5,2021-07-22 06:11:29
"Ultimate app for professionals to connect, share, learn from each other. Ultimate learning experience from the renowned world class instructor's. It's highly worth for someone who sends time on LinkedIn compared to many social networking sites. Helps to connect recruiter and job seeker using its powerful AI/ ML/ NLP technologies. I am sure Linkedin continue to add more featurs and improve end user experience. Gloabl app needs to be as inclusive as possible while it's localised while presented.",5,2021-07-22 04:25:58

Stay away from linkden premium. They say you can use desktop platform to cancel it. You can't. They don't have customer service number or any means to reach their team.

I personally got three job offers via LinkedIn but the only area of improvement needed is verifying the latest role and company the person is serving. I personally found many fake profiles are available in LinkedIn, here is the small work around to solve this issue. Work Around: 1. User will be updating the new role and the organization. 2. LinkedIn should ask for the Organizing Email id and the employee id. 3. Confirmation email / OTP should be sent to the organizational Email id. 4. Once the user confirms that then the role has to updated in the LinkedIn profile with ""LinkedIn Verified badge"" 5. LinkedIn can give additional Preferences to the ""Verified"" candidates to show their profile to the recruiters. Kindly try to implement this!!",1,2021-06-28 17:12:06

Good app to make productive connections and to look for jobs. However the app needs to be able to distinguish between 2 positions of similar nature. For example it needs to understand the difference between a Project / Transition Manager in the BFSI domain and the same in Software domain...

Also the price of the premium version is outrageous...,3,2021-06-14 20:10:55

I would've given it 4 stars if it weren't for two things. 1) Please add a Dark Mode to the mobile app . 2) Please make it mandatory for all current users as well as new users to verify who they are and then can they have access to the platform. This is because I've met and seen a lot of fake accounts.,4,2021-06-05 16:10:19

Having a good experience so far with LinkedIn. But recently I've noticed that the amount of relevant posts are going down and garbage posts from people are more in recommendation even though I unfollow such regularly. There are also complaints of harassment against women of the platform by some animals. This goes utterly against the professionalism of the platform.,2,2021-06-03 23:14:12

"Messaging SUCKS! I've been using this app religiously (read: all day, everyday) for several months as the main method of communication between me and my BFF. It's NEVER worked flawlessly. Lag on messages is absolutely INSUFFERABLE! And the last couple weeks, it's become almost unusable! (SEVERAL seconds between messages, sent or received.) Media often doesn't show unless you close and reopen the app. It's just awful. (BFF has all same issues.) Oh and no search feature in messages is PAINFUL!",1,2021-06-03 19:18:52
It is an excellent app! I have one observation related to job posting using Apply now. When you complete the entire job application process using Apply now and de-select the check box to unfollow related company or recruitment agency - the check box reverts back to green (checked) on final apply button. Seems a minor one but worth mentioning.,5,2021-06-03 18:38:55

"It's the necessary evil of the professional world, but highly functional. The feed has degrading into nothing more than your average social media loop of reposting information to announce popular news/blgpost headlines that have nothing to do with helping people find a job or hire somebody for one. It's like Twitter, but boring. But that's on the user side I guess. I do have a problem with the lack of vetting LinkedIn has when it comes to giving out my contact info to recruiters though.",3,2021-06-02 01:41:29

Do not try Premium account. This app will cheat you on the cancellation method. It will not allow you to cancel via the app (on which you already subscribed) but on the website browser.

So boring. Keeps showing the same posts over and over. It's even worse on mobile network (I guess to save on data plan).

Good evening Jacklyn We've been a subscribers to the Wall Street journal for over 30 years and then some. Until recently we have grown more dissatisfied with the way that you project the magazine the inclusions and articles that you include. More often than not recently it's more like reading pages from Ebony than from interesting articles that I used to enjoy in the magazine. Sure would be nice if you can vary the articles with more readable insertions. Thank you for your time sincerely Charles,2,2021-03-12 03:25:52

I've been trying unsuccessfully for 2 weeks to get a premium membership. Your bank servers are down all the time. Why do you make it so difficult for someone who's willing to shell out money for your app?,2,2021-02-21 09:35:41
Nagging notifications & mediocre interface. Cleaned up a little but overall like a used car salesman trying to get you on anything. Really just put out by the forced interactions and sloppy interface. The fact that I have to turn off notifications via android system rather than in app is like getting a restraining order for the door to door salesman that swings by at all hours. Update: still hate the interface. $60 a month for a membership is steep and excessive. Just another time suck.,2,2021-02-21 04:01:32

The worst app as it keeps showing old posts on the feed. While using on desktop there's an option to show recent/top posts I think this should be included in the app as to eliminate the act of seeing months old posts. It also shows false notifications of msgs.,1,2021-02-20 09:51:07

Gives a mobile app and all Trail subscriptions need to be cancelled on a browser. Why are you making is subscription available on this app. Worst service,1,2021-01-18 10:44:41
Immensely dislike the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE to use app just because there is an update available. If I wish to use an older version of the app then I should not be told I can't simply because there is a newer version out there!!!!!,1,2021-01-18 07:47:09

This app has locked me out for years. I have no idea why. I have tried the solutions and nothing works. Seems like LinkedIn holds themself in very high regards. I have never had this much trouble trying to log in with anything. Not even bank accounts.,1,2021-01-17 18:28:53
Great platform for be a virtual part and make connection of corporate world. You can make better deal and get lots of ideas.,5,2021-01-17 18:03:55
Can't believe that this app makes it this hard to opt out of paying for premium. You have to use a computer (using website via phone doesn't work) just to login so you can cancel your premium subscription.,2,2021-01-17 15:41:34

Should be more user friendly. Something should be done about managing connections and the whole setup needs to be worked on. Maybe the cpnstant posting. Posts should be managed well. Also the chats part should be more user friendly. Connections should be managed in more better way.,4,2021-01-16 00:50:07

"Great app if you need to connect with old colleagues but for 65 bucks a month is crazy, its just like Facebook. If you get the premium account, go to cancel it before you pay for for first month and they'll offer you considerable discount. They should really have two price point. One for the individual and one for business depending on amount of users or something. Can't justify the cost of this, especially when all i see is add revenue. P.S. they don't make it easy to cancel premium.",2,2021-01-16 00:11:16

"LinkedIn is a great app for finding work. but I find it works best for those who are looking for a more high profession. Not for the lower paying job seekers. Maybe some else might think differently. Another thing is I find it's hard to update my resume with this app, not sure why, but don't think it gives an update option. Maybe it's me but these are things I've found difficult in my experience on LinkedIn.",3,2021-01-15 15:36:22

"In general, a fantastic company, really valuable for professionals and we use it to connect, stay on top of, and celebrate, professional developments. My complaints about the app are 1) it needs a dark mode, 2) I'm starting to see the proliferation of ""suggested"" pages that feel like billboards you can't ignore. Social media already feels like a giant mall, please don't fall prey to this. In general, I would pay a small access fee to use LinkedIn but without the ads.",3,2021-01-14 23:45:37

I have LinkedIn premium and it's clearly mentioned on my profile I have around one year of experience.

That is unbelievably and incredibly stupid for a brand like LinkedIn üëé,1,2021-01-14 09:21:46
"It's a good app for the most part, but when they added the ""double-tap to like"" feature, it has really dampened the atmosphere. Now it's filled with a bunch of people that are only concerned with tricking others into liking their post.

I wish they'd get rid of that stupid feature and be a little stricter on what content is appropriate.",5,2021-01-14 08:20:20

"Permanent new message notifications when there's no new message (each time I open the app), this is really unbearable. Plus the silly change of styles, back and forth.

Because you have incompetent product managers ? Because you want to converge to a facebook copy ? (Check facebook figures btw.)",1,2021-01-06 16:17:54

I enjoyed using this app but your updates don't work. Since the Status updates it is impossible for me to upload a status or a post. Not only is this frustrating but completely counter productive as the purpose of the app is to connect and share within the auspices of one's professional interests. I am able to schedule and share /upload content via a third party social media resource yet unable to do it personally. Using a SM-N975f connected at no less than 50mbs. Fix it,1,2020-11-22 11:23:57

It would be nice if LinkedIn would stop forcing mobile browser users into their app. If I wanted to use the app I would open it myself. Many of the account management settings are not available in the app and cannot be accessed on a mobile device either because everytime I request to use the desktop site it forces me back to the app. Makes it really difficult to justify continuing to use the service if you cant ever access your full account on a mobile device yet alone ever paying for it.,1,2020-11-20 15:17:13

"Even if I saw you stab my dad in front of me and drown a bag full of puppies, I would still advise against the app or even joining Linkedin. What will happen is they will sign you up for the premium package (doesn't matter if you did or not) and drain your bank account $63.29 every couple of weeks. It's amazing I was able to find an email address I could direct this to, since there is no ""contact us email"" just a never ending cycle to the FAQ section...No way to cancel what you never ordered. I had to cancel my card and order a new one which will take 7 business days. Only 3 possible reasons for this issue 1. It's intentional, 2.

Maybe one star maybe enough for you.

I've applied in many companies and getting rejected for nothing.

This app is a scam. Though you can set up a subscription in the app you cannot cancel it in app. Linkedin does not contact you when your trial period is about to end nor does it tell you the cost of subscription. (The developer response does not address the concerns of my review and seems auto generated. My opinion remains the same).,1,2020-11-10 22:16:27
Why doesn't the app load more posts as user reaches at the end? Why do you force user to load posts by pressing load more button? It sounds lazy. Why do you only load 3-4 posts? You should load 10-12 posts at least.,3,2020-11-10 19:36:50

"Some bad features that need to be worked on: App by default notifies you of ""things you missed"" which tells you absolutely nothing and spams your phone notifications. You can turn this off but I literally never see notifications for things that are important. In the app notifications it spams you with a lot of jargon disguised as useful information that you have to open the app and check and clear out. Unsubscribing from all of them is a hassle because they seemingly have a different one for each day of the month. Jobs need to have a filter for what level of skill is needed. As a computer scientist, many entry level positions ask for multiple years of experience. This mean VASTLY different things to different companies. Many 'entry-level' positions just put years required just because they are looking for just some familiarity. As a recent college graduate I DO NOT want to even see senior software positions, and recruiters honestly do not want to see me applying there either. Promoted jobs are way to obtrusive, there might not be a good way around it but searching every few days and seeing the same promoted jobs posted a month ago wastes a bunch of time. Perhaps put a time-to-live after viewing so they only show at the top a few times instead of every time. Messaging will break for hours on end. The forums have nothing useful for the issue, and after searching for an hour turns out its impossible to get in contact with customer service because they have deleted any evidence of a helpline. It will take hours of effort to talk to a human for a niche issue. They REALLY want you to use the barebones FAQ that assumes you know nothing about how the app works and offers nothing for troubleshooting strange issues. Its way too easy for scam companies to contact you. Its very difficult to contact companies you have no connections with. It is hard to find the proper route to message companies with. Like sometimes I just want to talk to someone in HR about a job, but the only HR person I am available to connect with is the head of HR. I know they are not about to waste their time talking to me, so that's no good.",3,2020-10-22 18:08:48

"Not a fan. The UI is boring and outdated. Its not intimate enough of a platform for it to be affective. The #IndeedApp is a better place to be, for both parties. Avoid the rat race.

"With LinkedIn you are sure of professional connections, job, collaborations, learning and development in any chosen career. I have practically recommended hundreds of youths, graduates and aspiring young professionals. However, the apps needs to update and upgrade the dashboard in terms of feeds. The feeds can be unfriendly atimes as user tends to get lost between old and current feeds. The apps break intermittently, my user experience with content upload isn't cool. On a general note, it's a very good application.",4,2020-09-20 17:25:52

My account has been restricted for last many months more than 6months. Still I don't know what went wrong?? Who & how did my profile name change and why I am unable to access my account. Wasted years & efforts.,1,2020-08-21 21:30:48
"I find an app that should be optimized for use, inefficient when it comes to uploading and updating my profile. Just downloaded the recent update and its basically not allowing me to update my profile with an error message constantly coming up.

While effective for connections the experience is frustrating",2,2020-08-21 20:48:55

Always loved and lived the linkedin platform but the app has major challenges. Not able to upload my CV for days now and it does not even throw back an error or guidance.

"Repetitive Feed, Obnoxious Ads, Limited Content from 1st Degree Connections The app seems to be embracing a growth strategy of expanding users' networks and content visibility by favoring content from 2nd and 3rd connections interacted by first connections.

Furthermore, the feed only seems to refresh the top 1-4 posts. Ads are completely irrelevant.",2,2020-08-13 03:51:54

The forced update is terrible. I tried to create a company job alert & it won't let me do it without adding a position. Companies sometimes post the same position under different titles or there are various roles within a department that one would be a good fit for.

LinkedIn has allowed me to network with authors and writers. I enjoy reading the articles and meeting new people who enjoy the same things as I do. It's also a plus to be able to find more opportunities for employment.,5,2020-06-10 22:58:04
I think this app is very useful in building professional contacts and job search.,5,2020-06-10 22:50:37

This app has serious connectivity problems. Jun 2020 All working well love this app",5,2020-06-10 21:53:30
It's the best app to grow your network and professional experience. I have come to like it more because it's too quiet and organized than any other social media platforms which are mostly too noisy with irrelevant topics discussed. The trends on linked in are very experiential and easy to follow and to tap from the diverse skills of professionals who are ready to share and help out any time.,5,2020-06-10 21:51:21

Thanks to my reply. I trust LinkedIn will do the needful to make the app a nice experience as usual. Did the developers try writing a message of 5 lines as a feedback to story. Why not try to have some nice new feature like being able to pause the stories playing. Try to be a little innovative. It is sad how such a large company fail the essential principles of delivering a functioning app. One theory in business is that the bigger the company the less innovative it becomes.,2,2020-06-05 04:26:08

"Notifications should automatically disappear after having been seen to from other devices but they don't. There needs to be better syncing across devices else they're like fake alerts.

LinkedIn Please refer olx or some other applications that if we want to hire an employee using your application we should be able to create an alert where a person just by clicking that alert can apply and we can communicate with him/her and hire.

"LinkedIn is good for connecting people, for job updates and for new learnings but no one calls for a job opportunity via LinkedIn. It's just a platform where you can find new ideas about interviews.

To be honest when LinkedIn first started it might have been a place where you could have meaningful connections. Nowadays it's mostly third party recruiters messaging you for positions for which you're most likely not qualified. The only thing I found useful were the job postings there. I have sent close to 40+ in mail messages over the span of three months when I was looking for a job with zero meaningful replies. Just my two cents,1,2020-04-25 22:37:05

Still needs work. The typing function is a mess when filling it out ease of use is a mess very disappointing for such a big business. What we type in doesnt get saved unless we hit search.

"Annoying. Too many spammers and ads. Worse than Facebook...all strangers wasting my time. Most are recruitment people adding in people so they can cold canvass for placements. Often they attempt to lure people away from the jobs they just placed them in just to get the commission - these people need a tag to flag them as ""marketers / time wasters"" so those of us not looking and not wanting to waste time can avoid them. Recruiters and training marketers constantly add people in so they can pump advertisements at them - if I need their services (like a second hand car salesman) I could easily find them....Unfortunately there are also job-seekers making connections with hundreds of people in the vague hope that they can score an off-shore job and get out of India. Because of this I now rarely use Linked In at all. If I cannot escape them I may end up cancelling my account - and I know many others who feel the same way (employed people are too busy for this rubbish).

UPDATED:   With reference to Linkedin‚Äôs response. Even after the app is disabled it will periodically re-enable itself silently WITHOUT any user interaction or notification. There is another class of software that exhibits similar behaviour: Spyware or Malware. I don‚Äôt have an issue with software being pre-installed if I can remove it if I don‚Äôt want it. A user should not be forced to repeatedly disable an App ‚Äì No really should mean NO. I would simply say to be wary of sharing your contact details with a company that engages in such business practices.  --------  pre installed. cannot be removed. will not use a company that does this. utter rubbish.,1,2019-04-08 14:53:26

It boggles me how bad this aspect of the app is.,1,2019-03-14 20:24:34
Did a screencap of the popup and the file name exposed the app was actually Translate. They were just linking the popup's icon to LinkedIn's web page *** Retract the following entirely. The app has become a junk source of SPAM! It pop-ups full screen adds when you are not even in the app and as often as every hour. Probably in violation of Google developer guide lines since it is full screen and outside the app! Very unprofessional!

I receive push notifications but I can't do anything within the app. It always says ""we couldn't connect with LinkedIn"". No feed, no messages, no network, nothing... Connexion issues everywhere. However, the fix for me was to downgrade the app, and then everything worked again. No idea what happened, since no one else complained about it in the reviews. But if you have the same problem, here's my fix.",3,2018-12-09 13:28:55
Instills confidence when the app doesn't work and nothing but form letter responses to comments. Clearly can't hire qualified help if it's broken across the board. Customers obviously matter enough to not respond after weeks broken. Really justifies pushing pay version so much. I've always found it glitchy and unimpressive. And don't bother with the exquisitely helpful canned response. It's a waste of pixels.,1,2018-12-09 09:20:54
"Why is it so difficult to find the profile or the page showing the notification that LinkedIn just sent to your phone? ""Joe Doe added you on LinkedIn""...

The worst thing about this app is it TEMPORARILY blocks me and says I am using some kind of tool. Its an insult and attack on social behaviour. Just coz I view profiles of my connection frequently doesn't means I am using a tool.

Finally caved to installing the app due to the constant nagging that had to be dismissed in the web browser. First thing I tried was to find the settings to turn off push notifications. That process was a few minutes long fight with poor UI and UX design to find where those were. The number of back button presses to get out of those settings was ridiculous. Main functionality is just ok but almost all of it is pretty much just the web version with a few mobile navigation touches. No real UX distinction in my opinion to annoy and force people to use the app over the web version.,2,2018-12-06 14:49:20

"In the latest app update, in the ""'recommended for you"" section where you see contacts with whom you may want to connect; the method with which one views a person's page has been changed. Previously, clicking on the person's name would show you a brief and concise summary of the person's background. If one wasn't interested in that person's profile upon seeing the brief summary of his background, a simple swipe would show the next person's profile. This made for easy viewing of people's profiles and therefore meant connecting with a broader range of people was much easier. If one wanted to learn more about that person, he/she could then click ""View profile"". With this update, clicking on a person's page in the ""recommended for you"" section takes you straight to their full profile and doesn't then allow you to simply swipe to the next profile if you aren't interested.
